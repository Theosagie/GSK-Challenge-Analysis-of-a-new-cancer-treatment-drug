# GSK-Challenge-Analysis-of-a-new-cancer-treatment-drug
The project focused on evaluating the effectiveness of a new drug compared to the standard care in shrinking solid tumors in patients who do not respond to other treatments and identify patient subgroups that benefit more from the treatment. 
Please note that due to ethics and privacy, ‘Miraculon-B’ is only used to refer to the name of a drug being developed.

## **Tools and Methodology:**
• Followed the CRISP-DM methodology for a structured and systematic approach.                                                                                                                                                  • Utilized Python for data cleaning and analysis tasks.                                                                                                                                                                        • Power BI

## **Project Highlights**
• Conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into participants' response to treatment.
• Developed a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to predict patients likely to respond to Miraculon-B.
• Identified protein concentration as a predictive biomarker for treatment response while age, sex, weight do not contribute significantly to how patients responds
• Found that 54.83% of participants treated with Miraculon-B responded to treatment, compared to 32.21% in the control group.                                                                                                  • Patients with protein concentration below 117.286(ug/L) benefitted more from treatment using miraculon-B.
Specifically those with concentration below 76.429(ug/L)  had a 100% positive response.
• Presented the findings through visualizations and reported the results in a PowerPoint presentation.
• Developed an interactive dashboard using Power BI

## **Project Structure**
• Data Cleaning and preprocessing: Performed data cleaning tasks such as treating missing values, removing duplicates, and excluding records of participants under 18 years of age, checking class imbalance. 
• Created a new variable (BMI) based on patient’s weight and height and merged the two datasets.
• Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed the clinical trial data from different perspectives: participants treated with Miraculon-B and standard care, participants treated with Miraculon-B only 
and participants treated with the standard care only.                                                                                                                                                                          • Aggregated the data to compare various factors like protein concentration, weight, age, BMI
• Predictive Modeling: Developed a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict treatment response based on the data of participants treated with Miraculon-B.
• Feature Importance: Determined the importance of different features and found that protein concentration significantly affects the treatment response, while sex, age, and weight have minimal impact.
• Performance Metrics: Compared the response rates between Miraculon-B and the control group to evaluate the effectiveness of the new drug.
• Visualization: Created visualizations, including box plots, to identify trends and patterns in the data.                            
• Power BI dashboard to communicate key findings
• Presentation: Created a PowerPoint presentation to present the analysis, findings, and insights to stakeholders.

This project is based on a challenge presented by GSK in conjunction with dig data, focusing on the analysis of a clinical trial dataset for the Miraculon-B cancer treatment. The challenge aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and identify patient subgroups that benefit more.

## **Conclusion**
The pharmaceutical data analysis project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling. Through comprehensive data analysis, I have identified important insights and patterns in the clinical trial data, showcasing the potential of Miraculon-B.
